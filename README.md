## 🔭 What I'm building
Data pipelines that power analytics and AI — connecting diverse sources (platforms, APIs, databases) to cloud data warehouses with modern ELT architecture. Currently exploring RAG-enabled transformations and evaluating enterprise data integration platforms.

## 💡 Current focus
- 🤖 AI-enabled data pipelines with RAG capabilities for intelligent data transformation
- 🔄 SharePoint → Snowflake integration using Microsoft Graph API & modern orchestration
- 🔍 Enterprise data integration platform evaluation (Fivetran, Airbyte)
- 📊 Building resilient data infrastructure for analytics teams
